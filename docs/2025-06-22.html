<p>## ðŸŽ“ Nabla-R2D3: Effective and Efficient 3D Diffusion Alignment with 2D Rewards (2025-06-18)</p>
<p>- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Nabla-R2D3 is a reinforcement learning framework designed to improve 3D diffusion models using 2D rewards. It builds on Nabla-GFlowNet to enhance alignment with human preferences and produce realistic 3D assets. Experiments show it outperforms traditional finetuning, achieving better results with fewer steps.</p>
